Introduction
++++++++++++

Diagrams can quickly become cluttered and consequently difficult to work with, if all model elements, their contents and associated links are visible. For this reason, Modelio lets you decide whether to show or mask diagram components and referenced elements.

Elements can be shown by:

* dragging and dropping them from the “Model” view into a diagram
* using the *“Unmask”* command in the context menu
* defining an automatic unmask policy in the *“Symbol”* view

Elements can be masked by:

* using the *“Ctrl+M”* shortcut in the diagram edition view
* using the *“Mask”* command in the context menu
* defining an automatic mask policy in the *“Symbol”* view
