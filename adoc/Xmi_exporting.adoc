The Modelio XMI export operation is used to generate XMI files from models built in Modelio.

The “XMI Export” command can only be run from a package.

Key:

When the “Adding Modelio annotations” option has been activated, more information will be exported, ensuring maximum compatibility in the case of a re-import into Modelio. Some information available in Modelio but not present in UML2 can be retrieved in this way.

image:images/Xmi_exporting/4.png[image]. In the “Extension” field, define the extension that will be assigned to the file you are going to export (either “.xmi” ou “.uml”).

Partial export
++++++++++++++

With Modelio XMI Import/Export, you can carry out a partial export. To do this, simply run the export command from any of your project’s “Package” type elements.

The scope of the export will then be limited to the sub-elements of the package from which the command is run. Any links to elements outside this package are severed.
